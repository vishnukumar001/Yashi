"""
Two-step confirmation flow for dangerous power actions.

Step 1: requestPowerAction(action) -> mints a single-use, short-lived token
        and tells Yashi (via the result string) to ask the user to confirm.
Step 2: executePowerAction(action, execute_token) -> validates the token and,
        only if it matches & is unexpired, performs the gated action.

A token is bound to a single action name and can be consumed exactly once.
